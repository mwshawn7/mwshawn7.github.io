## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a Sub-Divisional Engineer at Bangladesh Water Development Board, currently posted in Magura. Over the years, I’ve had the opportunity to work across diverse regions—starting at the Planning Office in Dhaka, then gaining hands-on field experience in coastal Cox’s Bazar, and now continuing my journey in the heart of southwestern Bangladesh.

Though my academic background is in Environmental Engineering from BUET—where I focused on anaerobic wastewater treatment for my thesis—I’ve since transitioned into the field of Water Resources Engineering. My professional interests lie in riverbank erosion, channel shifting, and sediment transport—areas I plan to explore further through future research and publication.

Beyond engineering design and project implementation, I have a strong inclination toward data-driven decision-making. I work regularly with tools like Microsoft Excel, Python, and ArcGIS for spatial and statistical analysis. I’m also experienced in public procurement and contract management within government infrastructure projects.

With each project and region I serve, I aim to contribute to sustainable water management solutions tailored to the unique challenges of Bangladesh.
