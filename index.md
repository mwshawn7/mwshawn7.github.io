## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a Sub-Divisional Engineer at the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB), currently stationed in Magura. My professional journey has taken me from the strategic corridors of the Planning Office in Dhaka to the dynamic coastal landscapes of Cox’s Bazar, and now to the heart of southwestern Bangladesh. Each posting has enriched my understanding of the nation's diverse water resource challenges.

My academic foundation lies in Environmental Engineering, having earned my B.Sc. from BUET. My undergraduate thesis focused on the anaerobic treatment of textile wastewater using a Hybrid Up-flow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (HUASB) reactor, reflecting my early commitment to sustainable environmental solutions. Transitioning into Water Resources Engineering, I have developed a keen interest in riverbank erosion, channel shifting, and sediment transport—areas I am eager to explore further through future research and publications.

In my professional role, I blend engineering expertise with data-driven decision-making. Proficient in tools like Microsoft Excel, Python, and ArcGIS, I conduct spatial and statistical analyses to inform project planning and implementation. Additionally, I have substantial experience in public procurement and contract management, ensuring transparency and efficiency in government infrastructure projects.

Beyond my technical endeavors, I am passionate about contributing to sustainable water management practices that address the unique challenges faced by Bangladesh. I am committed to continuous learning and collaboration, aiming to make a meaningful impact in the field of water resources engineering.
